# Trigger Boundary Policy

This repository depends on clear trigger boundaries because multiple orchestrators and narrower skills operate on the same domain.

## Main rule

`ai-research-reproduction` should trigger only for end-to-end README-first deep learning repo reproduction requests, the Rigor Reproduce mode.

`ai-research-explore` should trigger only for explicit end-to-end exploration on top of `current_research`, the Rigor Explore mode for candidate hypotheses rather than verified novelty.

Narrower skills should trigger only for explicitly narrower requests:

- repo intake and planning
- environment and asset preparation
- minimal execution and audit
- narrow paper-context recovery
- code-only exploration
- run-only exploration

When a prompt asks to "analyze the current project" or "understand this repo"
without active execution or modification, prefer `analyze-project` over both
main orchestrators.

When a prompt asks for a trusted reproduction from the README, prefer
`ai-research-reproduction` and do not route into exploration.

When a prompt asks to explore on top of a durable `current_research` anchor and
mentions coordinated candidate code and run work, prefer `ai-research-explore`.
If the request is only code adaptation, prefer `explore-code`; if it is only a
sweep or short-cycle run, prefer `explore-run`.

## Design rule for front matter descriptions

Each `description` should contain both:

- a positive routing clause: `Use when ...`
- an exclusion clause: `Do not use for ...`

This matters because the front matter is the strongest pre-trigger signal.

## Mis-trigger risks to control

- `ai-research-reproduction` firing on simple repo scan requests
- `ai-research-reproduction` firing on generic paper summary requests
- `ai-research-explore` firing on narrow code-only exploration
- `ai-research-explore` firing on narrow run-only exploration
- `ai-research-explore` firing on ambiguous "improve this" prompts without explicit exploratory authorization
- any explore skill presenting novelty, contribution, SOTA, or trusted-baseline claims without evidence support
- `repo-intake-and-plan` firing on environment-only requests
- `env-and-assets-bootstrap` firing on repo scan prompts
- `minimal-run-and-audit` firing before a target command exists
- `paper-context-resolver` firing on general literature requests

## Testing strategy

Use both:

1. static overlap checks on front matter descriptions
2. prompt-suite boundary tests with positive, boundary, and negative cases

Static checks are not enough because overlap often appears only when descriptions are exercised against realistic prompts.
